# Tests that add Nodes correctly


# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1 and n2
graph contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in multiNodeGraph are:
the children of n2 in multiNodeGraph are:
